# Evently: 
- Your task is to create Evently a small scale booking/ticketing platform! 
- Evently is a simple platform and does not need super complicated code! 
- code should be readable.
- identifier names should be simple < 15 charecters.
- code should be distributed into folders with appropriate folder structure. 
- Utilise OOP and SOLID principles to write clean. 
- code should never be repeated and be easy to understand. 
- no need to implement fancy features such as custom exceptions. 
- remember, evently is just a demo application and does not need to handle thousands of writes. 
- it just needs to be a simple proof concept. 
- we will not be creating an authentication system. 
- it is important to write tests for all of the implemented endpoints and ensure they behave correctly. 
- test should be simple with simple assert statements and should be easy to figure out which specific feature is not working!
